    <h1>Animating and Modeling</h1>
    <h3>Why modeling interests me?</h3>
    <p>I have started to learn modeling through Blender which is a free and open source 3D creation suite so that I may
      create high quality assets for future games. I also find modeling extremely interesting and complex. </p>
    <h3>Why animating interests me?</h3>
    <p>I am interested in animation because I find it cool to be able to create smooth and good looking animations that
      can be used in games or videos. I have started learning animation through Blender as well because it is free and
      offers many different tools that can assist me in creating complex animations.</p>
